# LangchainPromptCatalyst

#### 1. Here we got to learn how to create prompts using PromptTemplate in Langchain.
#### 2. The ".format" function shows what the input is going to be fed to the LLM Model.
#### 3. Then we run that by creating a chain with the prompt as defined by us & the model as "OpenAI".
#### 4 .Finally by ".run" method the model gives the output.
#### 5 .We also learnt about "FewShotPromptTemplate" in which we give examples of what we exactly want & give that prompt to the model to get the desired output.
